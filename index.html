	<p><font face="calibri" size="5" color="FF1111">Our computer is from old time. But it is very very useful to me during lockdown. Because of this only, I learnt many things such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Powerpoint, .bat script etc. The main thing and very useful thing i ever learnt was typwriting. It brought unique identity to me in my class. Before lockdown I only use this computer for games, drawings. I dont know that we can learn these much of things in computer. I first learnt typwriting. Then MS Word, command prompt (CMD) etc. Before online classes our computer has only monitor, cpu, mouse and a keyboard. Because of online classes, we bought headset, webcam, new mouse and mousepad, home theatre, external hard disk, Jio Router or JIO Modem, a new phone, wifi adapter. Our computer got reset or repaired approximately 3 or 4 times. Our Operating system version is Windows 7. I am very sad about that. So, I asked computer shop worker to install windows 10. But it did not worked. Now we will go to detailed information of our computer.</font>
